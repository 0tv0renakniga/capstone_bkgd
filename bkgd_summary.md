# Results of the First National Survey of User Needs for Space Weather
- Space Weather Advisory Group (2024)

## Overarching Themes

### Overarching Theme 1. Regionalization and Impacts
- There is a shared demand for space weather forecasts that are more geographically specific (regionalized) and detailed (granular)
- Sector-Specific Needs: While "regionalization" varies by industry, the collective goal is to move away from broad global averages toward localized data.
- Actionable Data: There is a specific call for forecasts that include potential impacts, allowing organizations to understand exactly how an event will affect their specific operations.
- Improved Capabilities: To achieve this, the sectors identified three primary areas for improvement:
    - Local Infrastructure: More ground-based or local measurements.
    - Advanced Warning: Longer lead times for forecast products.
- Environmental Characterization: A deeper understanding of how space weather interacts with specific local environments.

### Overarching Theme 3. Data Archives, Access (Latency), and Automation
- To effectively support both real-time operations and long-term planning, space weather data must evolve toward a more automated, standardized, and collaborative framework.
- AI and Machine Learning Readiness: As modeling becomes more complex, data archives must be modernized to support computational growth
- Machine Readability: Formatting data so it is easily ingested by AI/ML algorithms.
- Interoperability: Bridging the gap between historical and modern datasets to allow for seamless model validation and verification.

## Electric Power Sector

### Electric Power Sector: Issues
- Current Failure Point: The magnetometer network in North America is too geographically limited. This forces planners to rely on estimated field data, which reduces the accuracy and quality of their safety validations.
- Current Failure Point: Existing tools cannot handle the "expansive analysis" required to fully understand system vulnerabilities to GICs.

### Electric Power Sector: Modeling Space Weather and the Grid
- Model validation using measurements of geomagnetic fields and GICs are a top priority among many survey participants to ensure vulnerability assessments are representative of realistic conditions and severe GMD event

### Electric Power Sector: Findings
- Finding 2.4. Effective GIC mitigation is an interdisciplinary, cross-sector, and community-wide effort requiring increased collaboration between DOE, the National Labs, and the power industry. 
    - Recommendation 2.4.1. DOE, the National Labs, and power industry should collaborate to update vulnerability assessment tools and capabilities.

## Research Sector

### Research Sector: Issues
- A Systems-Based Research Approach: To move beyond current limitations, researchers advocate for viewing the Sun-Earth environment as a single, integrated system
- Satellite Constellations: Using groups of sensors to gain a holistic view of the Sun-Earth system rather than isolated data points.

### Research Sector: Systems Approach to Space Weather Research
- The research community advocates for a holistic "Sun-to-Earth" model. Rather than looking at isolated events, researchers need to understand the self-consistent interactions between the solar driver and the Earth’s lower atmosphere.
- While geophysical data is plentiful, there is a severe lack of impact data (how space weather actually affects power grids and satellites). This information is often locked away as proprietary or sensitive, preventing researchers from validating how well their models predict real-world damage.
- Unified Repository: The lack of a system-wide data archive for both observations and past forecasts is a major barrier to progress.
- Performance Audits: Researchers need to conduct "post-mortem" studies on past forecasts to verify and validate numerical models.
- LEO Utilization: In-situ data from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites is an untapped resource for improving model accuracy
- Current forecasting is hindered by "operational fragility" and significant data blind spots:
    - New Strategies: Bridging these gaps requires satellite constellations and expanded ground station capacity for real-time data ingestion.
    - Solar Coverage: We currently only observe about 1/3 of the solar surface. Gaps in the other 2/3 and a lack of polar observations severely limit forecast accuracy beyond 3 days.

### Research Sector: Findings and Recommendations
- Finding 7.3. Users need reliable data access to historical and ongoing critical observations, and improved spatial and temporal resolution of key parameters, to sustain and advance R&D programs and prediction capabilities
  - Recommendation 7.3.3. NASA, NOAA, NSF, DOE, and DOD should ensure that archived data is comprehensive, cross-referenced, well documented, well calibrated, interoperable, and accessible by artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) techniques.
- Finding SWAG 7.1. Non-Keplerian39 observations can improve forecast lead time and accuracy.

# The Next Decade of Discovery in Solar and Space Physics: Exploring and Safeguarding Humanity's Home in Space
- National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2025)

## Solar and Space Physics
- The past decade has demonstrated the importance of multispacecraft, multipoint measurements in identifying fundamental physics of multiscale spatial and temporal processes. 
- MMS provides a compelling rationale for multipoint measurements, effectively creating a laboratory in space, if transformative progress is to be made in understanding the building blocks of a highly coupled complex multiscale heliospheric system.
- International collaborations significantly increase a mission’s capabilities, whether by collaborating on the instrumentation suite (provision of instruments, addition of expertise, etc.) or even creating synergies between independent missions, such as occurred between the Japanese Arase mission (formerly known as Exploration of Energization and Radiation in Geospace) and Van Allen Probes to the considerable enrichment of both.
- Advancements in physics-based models have enabled linking different regions of the atmosphere, treating it as one system from the surface of Earth to the edge of space.
- Earth’s ionosphere–thermosphere–mesosphere system is a highly coupled mixture of neutral gas and charged plasma that surrounds Earth. This region responds strongly to external forces, both from drivers in the lower atmosphere and from the Sun and magnetosphere above

## New and Emerging Frontiers in Science
### Sun-Earth-Space: Guiding Questions and Research Focus Areas
- Question 1: How does our Heliosphere function as a nested system?
    - Research Focus Areas: Interactions across large scale regions and long time scales, Dominant physical process within system interactions, Energy and momentum flow within parts 
- Question 2: How do heliosystem boundaries manifest themselves?
    - Research Focus Areas: System impacts of magnetic boundary processes, Role of transition regions in system coupling
- Question 3: How do the Sun-Earth system parts interact with each other?
    - Research Focus Areas: Magnetic connections across the Heliosystem, Multiple drivers and feedback mechanisms

### Sun-Earth-Space: System-Level Approach
- To achieve a true systems-level understanding of space weather (such as CMEs and the aurora), the research community must move away from isolated studies and adopt an orchestrated, multi-dimensional approach.
- Integrated Resource Management: Success requires the synchronized use of space missions, ground facilities, theoretical research, and advanced data analytics.
- Focus on Subsystem Interactions: The priority is understanding how different components of the space environment interact with one another, rather than just studying them in isolation.
- The "Mesoscale" Challenge: Current models often struggle with "intermediate scales"—phenomena that are too large for kinetic views but too small for global systems views. A strategic approach is needed to bridge this gap.

### Sun-Earth-Space: Energy Transfer Across Boundaries
- Dual Driving Forces:A major open question is the "tug-of-war" between two different drivers:
    - Solar Wind Driving: Energy coming from the Sun (CMEs, fast streams).
    - Atmospheric Driving: Energy transferred upward from Earth’s lower atmosphere into the ionosphere. Research is needed to determine which driver dominates under different conditions.
- The Need for Constellations: Because mesoscale structures are too large for a single satellite but too small for global remote sensing to capture in detail, the text advocates for:
    - Spacecraft Constellations: Multiple points of measurement to resolve intermediate structures.
- Integration with Modeling: Due to the vastness of space, physical observations alone will never be enough. Comprehensive numerical modeling must be used to fill the gaps between satellite measurements and provide a complete picture of energy and plasma transport.

### Sun-Earth-Space: Energy Exchange Between Plasmas and Neutrals
- The Upper Atmosphere as a "Transition Zone"
  - The upper atmosphere (ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere) acts as a high-stakes meeting point where physics changes from a well-mixed gas to a nearly collisionless plasma. It is simultaneously "forced" by two opposing directions:
    - From Above: Driven by solar radiation, plasma transport from the magnetosphere, and explosive energy releases.
    - From Below: Driven by neutral particle winds, temperatures, and composition changes originating in the lower atmosphere (stratosphere and troposphere).
- The Observational Blind Spot
  - Currently, science cannot distinguish the relative impact of these two drivers. We lack the "sequence of events" data needed to pinpoint whether a change in the upper atmosphere was caused by solar activity or internal Earth weather processes.
- Missing Links in Energy Transport
  - There is a critical need to understand how mass, momentum, and energy move across internal transition regions. Current methods are too limited to follow these dynamics in enough detail to see how the system redistributes energy.
- Key Future Missions
  - Two upcoming NASA constellation missions are identified as the solution to these gaps:
    - GDC (Geospace Dynamics Constellation): To measure electromagnetic inputs at various latitudes.
    - DYNAMIC (Dynamical Neutral Atmosphere–Ionosphere Coupling): To observe how the system processes and redistributes energy coming from both above and below.

The Need for "System-Wide" Solar Observations
To move beyond current limitations, the research community requires a more comprehensive observational toolkit
Multi-Vantage Point Measurements

### Sun-Earth-Space: Magnetic Fields as Connectors
- Magnetic Fields as "Invisible Links"
  - The Earth’s magnetic field acts as a connector between the magnetosphere (high altitude) and the ionosphere (upper atmosphere).
    - Low Latitudes: The dipolar field couples the Northern and Southern hemispheres.
    - High Latitudes: The field couples the ionosphere to distant, complex parts of the magnetosphere.
- The Challenge of "Magnetic Mapping"
  - Connecting a specific event in deep space to a specific spot in the atmosphere (like an aurora) is extremely difficult because:
    - The Magnetotail Problem: In the "tail" of the magnetosphere, the field is stretched and constantly shifting. A massive volume of space in the tail may map to only a tiny, precise spot in the ionosphere.
    - The Transition Region: This area is dominated by "mesoscale" flows and rapid variations that current physics-based models struggle to predict.
- Unexplained Hemispheric Asymmetries
  - Auroras in the North and South poles are often surprisingly different (asymmetric). These differences are caused by:
    - Earth's dipole being slightly off-center and tilted.
    - Short-term changes in solar wind flow.
- The Observation Gap: A lack of data from the Southern Hemisphere currently prevents scientists from fully quantifying or modeling these asymmetries.
- Path to Progress
  - To solve these mapping mysteries, the research community identifies three requirements:
    - Simultaneous Imaging: Capturing auroral distributions over both hemispheres at the exact same time.
    - Ground-Space Synergy: Combining satellite data with ground-based magnetic disturbance networks (like SuperMAG) and current-tracking projects (like AMPERE).
    - Improved Empirical Models: Moving beyond current statistical models which contain "significant uncertainties."
  
### Sun-Earth-Space: Synopsis
- The Multi-Scale Challenge: The system must be understood across extreme ranges, from micro-scales (wave-particle interactions lasting fractions of a second) to system-wide scales (solar cycles lasting decades).
- The Sparsity Problem: Despite new ground and space-based sensors, the observing network remains fundamentally sparse within the vast volume of the heliosphere.
- The AI/ML Mandate: To bridge the gap between "sparse data" and "system understanding," the field explicitly requires advances in Data Assimilation, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision.
- The Hardware Shift: Future modeling relies on the transition to exascale computing, cloud storage (petabytes), and AI-optimized hardware.
- The Data Fusion Core: There is a specific, high-priority need to calibrate across heterogeneous instrument suites (combining different types of sensors) to assess the state of the system

# Global landscape of space weather observations, research and operations
- Advances in Space Research: Ishii et al. (2025)

## Abstract
- Risks to Critical Infrastructure
    - Space weather is no longer just a scientific curiosity; it is a direct threat to the modern economy.
- GNSS Vulnerability
  - High-precision satellite positioning (GPS/GNSS) is now essential for social and economic infrastructure. However, ionospheric variations can degrade the accuracy and reliability of these systems.
- Aviation & Power 
  - Space weather events can disrupt flight communications and cause damaging surges in electric power grids.
- The Global Monitoring Gap
    - Because space weather is a global phenomenon, it cannot be monitored by any single entity. The current landscape is fragmented:
      - Ground-based: Mostly managed by local governments or academic institutions.
      - Space-based: Typically operated by national space agencies.
- A Call for Strategic Collaboration
  - The paper emphasizes that enhancing our ability to monitor, forecast, and mitigate impacts depends on two levels of cooperation:
    - Intra-national: Better coordination between agencies and private entities within a single country.
    - International: Alignment between national space programs to share data and manage large-scale observation projects.
- Overview of the National Landscape
  - The authors review how different nation-states and regional space agencies are currently handling research and operations, providing a "map" of global capabilities designed to help strengthen future mitigation strategies

  - Guidelines
    - ​This is not a rubric! Completing all sections below will not guarantee you a certain grade. We​ ​are providing this to help structure your report.
    - The report should be no more than 4 double​ column pages, excluding contributions (8) and references (11). 
    - Text exceeding 4 pages is not​ considered part of report​
    - ​Abstract​​[≈ 1 paragraph]​ ​It should consist of 1 paragraph consisting of the motivation for your paper and a high​ ​level explanation of the methodology you used/results obtained.​
    - ​Introduction​​[≈ 2 paragraphs]​Explain the problem, why it is important and your motivation for pursuing this problem.​ Give some background if necessary. Clearly state what the input and output is. Be very​ explicit: “The input to our algorithm is an {image, amplitude, patient age, grayscale​ video}. We then use a {SVM, neural network, linear regression, etc.} to output a​ ​predicted {age, stock price, cancer type, music genre, etc.}.” This is very important since​ each team has different inputs/outputs spanning many application domains. Being​ ​explicit about this makes it easier for readers.
    - ​Related work​​[≈ 2 paragraph]​You should find existing papers, group them into categories based on their​ approaches, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses, as well as how they are​ ​similar to and differ from your work. In your opinion, which approaches were​ ​clever/good? What is the state-of-the-art? Do most people perform the task by hand?​ ​You should aim to have at least 5 references in the related work. Include previous​ ​attempts by others at your problem, previous technical methods, or previous learning​ ​algorithms.
    - ​Dataset and Features​​[≈ 0.5 pages]​​Describe your dataset: how many training/validation/test examples do you have? Is​​ there any preprocessing you did? What about normalization or data augmentation?​ ​What is the resolution of your images? How is your time-series data discretized?​ ​Include a citation on where you obtained the data. List the probable predictive tasks​ you can do with the dataset and why you chose to do one of these tasks as a part of​ ​your project over others. For example, for dataset with images of cats, you can find​ ​cats' position in the images, classify whether an image has a cat or not (or) classify cat​ ​based on breed if a cat is present in the image. Show some examples from your​ ​dataset. You should talk about the features you used. If you extracted features using​ Fourier transforms, PCA, ICA, etc. make sure to talk about it. Include examples of your​ data in the report (e.g. include an image, show a waveform).​
    - ​Methods​​[≈ 1 pages]​ Describe your learning algorithms or proposed algorithm(s). Make sure to include​ relevant mathematical notation. For example, you can briefly include the SVM​ ​optimization objective/formula or say what the softmax function is. It is okay to use​​formulas from the lecture notes. For each algorithm, give a short description (≈1​paragraph) of how it works. Again, we are looking for your understanding of how these​ ​machine learning algorithms work. Although the TAs know the algorithms, future​​readers may not. Additionally, if you are using a niche or cutting-edge algorithm you​ ​may want to explain your algorithm using a paragraph.​
    - ​Experiments/Results/Discussion​​[≈ 2 pages]​ ​Give details about what (hyper)parameters you chose (e.g. why did you use X learning​rate for gradient descent, what was your mini-batch size and why) and how you chose​ them. Did you do cross-validation, if so, how many folds? Before listing results, list and​ ​explain what your primary metrics are: accuracy, precision. Provide equations for the​ ​metrics if necessary. For results, have a mixture of tables and plots. For a classification​ ​problem, include a confusion matrix. Include performance metrics such as precision,​ recall, and accuracy. For regression problems, state the average error. Include​ visualizations of results, heatmaps, examples of where your algorithm failed and a​ ​discussion of why certain algorithms fail/succeed. Make sure to discuss the​ figures/tables in your main text throughout this section. Plots should include legends,​ axis labels, and have font sizes that are legible when printed.​
    - ​Conclusion​​[≈ 1 paragraph]​ Summarize your report and reiterate key points. Which algorithms were the highest​​performing? Why do you think that some algorithms worked better than others?​ Report should be 4 pages to this point.​
    - ​​References/Bibliography​​[No page limit]​​Include citations for: (1) Any papers mentioned in the related work section. (2) Papers​ describing algorithms that you used. (3) Code or libraries you downloaded and used.​ ​This includes libraries such as scikit-learn, Matlab toolboxes, Tensorflow, etc. We are​ ​excluding the references section from the page limit to encourage a thorough literature​ review/related work section without being space-penalized.​
